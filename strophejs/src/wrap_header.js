/** File: strophe.js
 *  A JavaScript library for writing XMPP clients.
 *
 *  This library uses either Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)
 *  to emulate a persistent, stateful, two-way connection to an XMPP server or
 *  alternatively WebSockets.
 *
 *  More information on BOSH can be found in XEP 124.
 *  For more information on XMPP-over WebSocket see this RFC:
 *  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7395
